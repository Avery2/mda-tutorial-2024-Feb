# Step 1: Choose Your Theme

- Think about what your webpage will be about. Is it for a **sports team**, a **school event**, or something else fun and exciting?
- Decide on a name for your webpage. Make it catchy and related to your theme!

Remember, this webpage is yours, so make it about something you love or find interesting!
